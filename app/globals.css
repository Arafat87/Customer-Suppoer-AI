* {
  box-sizing: border-box;

  margin: 0;
}

/** This is a CSS rule that applies to all elements (*) on the page.

Here's what it does:

1.box-sizing: border-box; sets the box model to border-box, which means that the width and height of an element includes its padding and border, 
rather than just its content.
2. padding: 0; sets the padding of all elements to 0, which means that there will be no 
space between the content of an element and its border.
3. margin: 0; sets the margin of all elements to 0, which means that there will be no space between elements.
This is often referred to as a "reset" or "normalize" rule, 
as it resets the default styles of all elements to a consistent baseline. 
This can help to ensure that all elements on the page have a consistent layout and appearance, 
and can make it easier to write CSS rules that apply to specific elements.

It's worth noting that this rule is quite broad, and may have unintended consequences if you're not careful.
For example, if you have an element that relies on a default margin or padding to function correctly, 
this rule may break its layout. It's often a good idea to use a more targeted approach to resetting styles, 
rather than applying a blanket rule to all elements.
